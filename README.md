# Advanced-Forecasting-Techniques-Project
Our project focuses on helping the retail businesses improve inventory planning to increase sales and reduce waste by forecasting future customer demand. We analyze the past demand patterns to predict for the upcoming weeks and months. We need to understand the seasonal trends, holiday effects, and consumer behavior over time so businesses can make smarter decisions. The questions we want to answer: when to increase for peak demand periods; how promotion or seasonal events influence demand; how far ahead accurate planning is possible. How external factors influence sales, such as the unemployment rate, fuel prices, and whether CPI corresponds with sales. The data contains these columns: Store: A unique identifier for each retail store.
Date: Represents the week of sales, indicating the specific weekly period for the recorded data.
Weekly_Sales: The total sales for the given store during that particular week.
Holiday_Flag: A binary indicator showing whether the week in question was a holiday week (1 for holiday, 0 for non-holiday).
Temperature: The recorded temperature on the day the sales data was collected.
Fuel_Price: The cost of fuel in the region corresponding to the store during the sales week.
CPI: Stands for Consumer Price Index, providing an economic indicator for the period.
Unemployment: The unemployment rate in the region during the sales week. 
We will implement three model categories: baseline models, classical time-series models, and advanced models. The models will be evaluated using a train-test split and multiple accuracy metrics. Results will be analyzed not only for accuracy but also for practical business insights. 
## **1. Data Description**
###  **1.1 Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project consists of weekly sales observations from multiple retail stores. Each record reflects a store’s total weekly sales, alongside several contextual variables that may influence consumer demand. The dataset covers a continuous weekly time range beginning in February 2010, with consistent entries across stores. The primary purpose of this dataset is to support the development of forecasting models that can assist retailers in optimising inventory planning and understanding demand fluctuations associated with seasonal, economic, and behavioural factors.
###  **1.2 Variables Included in the Dataset**
The dataset contains the following variables, as confirmed from the raw data:

**Store:** A numerical identifier representing each retail store.

**Date:** The weekly date of the sales entry, formatted as DD-MM-YYYY.

**Weekly_Sales:** The total sales amount generated by the store during the specified week; this is the target variable for forecasting.

**Holiday_Flag:** A binary indicator specifying whether the week contains a holiday (1 = holiday week, 0 = non-holiday week).

**Temperature:** The recorded temperature for the corresponding week, representing environmental conditions that may influence consumer behaviour.

**Fuel_Price:** The fuel price in the region of the store during the week.

**CPI (Consumer Price Index):** An index reflecting the general price level and inflation for the period.

**Unemployment:** The unemployment rate in the region for that week.

These variables represent a combination of store-level performance metrics and external economic and environmental factors, enabling both univariate and multivariate forecasting approaches.

###  **1.3 Purpose of Analysis**

The analysis aims to investigate how weekly sales are shaped by:

Seasonal and recurring demand patterns

Holiday effects and event-driven variations

The feasible forecasting horizon for reliable inventory planning

The influence of external variables such as fuel prices, unemployment rate, and CPI

Understanding these relationships will support retailers in anticipating demand more accurately and reducing stockouts or excess inventory.

###  **1.4 Modelling Approach**

Three categories of forecasting models will be applied:

Baseline models (e.g., naive and seasonal naive benchmarks)

Classical time-series models (ARIMA, exponential smoothing, Prophet)

Advanced models (e.g., RNN, LSTM, Transformer-based approaches)

Models will be evaluated using a train–test split and multiple accuracy metrics. In addition to predictive performance, interpretability and practical business relevance will be considered.
