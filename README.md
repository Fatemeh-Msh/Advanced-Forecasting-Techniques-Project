# Advanced-Forecasting-Techniques-Project
## **Introduction**
Accurate demand forecasting is essential for retail businesses, as it supports effective inventory planning, reduces waste, and prevents stock shortages. Weekly sales are influenced by multiple factors, including seasonal trends, holiday events, and broader economic conditions, making reliable forecasting methods crucial for operational decision-making.

This project aims to predict weekly sales across multiple retail stores using historical data and supplementary external variables such as temperature, fuel prices, unemployment rates, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The analysis addresses key questions, including when peak demand occurs, how holidays and economic conditions influence sales, and how far ahead retailers can forecast with confidence.

To explore these questions, the study implements baseline models, classical time-series methods, and advanced machine-learning models. Model performance is assessed using a train–test split and multiple accuracy metrics. The overall objective is to identify effective forecasting approaches while providing insights that can enhance real-world retail inventory management.

## **1. Data Description**
###  **1.1 Dataset Overview**
The dataset used in this project consists of weekly sales observations from multiple retail stores. Each record reflects a store’s total weekly sales, alongside several contextual variables that may influence consumer demand. The dataset covers a continuous weekly time range beginning in February 2010, with consistent entries across stores. The primary purpose of this dataset is to support the development of forecasting models that can assist retailers in optimising inventory planning and understanding demand fluctuations associated with seasonal, economic, and behavioural factors.
###  **1.2 Variables Included in the Dataset**
The dataset contains the following variables, as confirmed from the raw data:

**Store:** A numerical identifier representing each retail store.

**Date:** The weekly date of the sales entry, formatted as DD-MM-YYYY.

**Weekly_Sales:** The total sales amount generated by the store during the specified week; this is the target variable for forecasting.

**Holiday_Flag:** A binary indicator specifying whether the week contains a holiday (1 = holiday week, 0 = non-holiday week).

**Temperature:** The recorded temperature for the corresponding week, representing environmental conditions that may influence consumer behaviour.

**Fuel_Price:** The fuel price in the region of the store during the week.

**CPI (Consumer Price Index):** An index reflecting the general price level and inflation for the period.

**Unemployment:** The unemployment rate in the region for that week.

These variables represent a combination of store-level performance metrics and external economic and environmental factors, enabling both univariate and multivariate forecasting approaches.

###  **1.3 Purpose of Analysis**

The analysis aims to investigate how weekly sales are shaped by:

Seasonal and recurring demand patterns

Holiday effects and event-driven variations

The feasible forecasting horizon for reliable inventory planning

The influence of external variables such as fuel prices, unemployment rate, and CPI

Understanding these relationships will support retailers in anticipating demand more accurately and reducing stockouts or excess inventory.

###  **1.4 Modelling Approach**

Three categories of forecasting models will be applied:

Baseline models (e.g., naive and seasonal naive benchmarks)

Classical time-series models (ARIMA, exponential smoothing, Prophet)

Advanced models (e.g., RNN, LSTM, Transformer-based approaches)

Models will be evaluated using a train–test split and multiple accuracy metrics. In addition to predictive performance, interpretability and practical business relevance will be considered.
