        "\n",
        "Retail demand forecasting helps stores to see that how their weekly sales action during the year. In many retail studies, sales usually rise and fall with seasons, holidays, and changes in prices or local conditions (Neba et al., 2024; Malik et al., 2024). In our data, this pattern also appears clearly. The Seasonal Naive model already gives a strong baseline, which shows that the weekly sales follow a repeated yearly cycle (Sbrana & Silvestrini, 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "###**1-2\tWHY FORECASTING WEEKLY SALES MATTERS**\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowing the expected sales for each week helps stores organise their work more calmly. When they have an idea of the coming demand, they can order products on time and avoid empty shelves or extra stock. Earlier research in retail also points out that short-term forecasts make everyday decisions—like planning staff or preparing for busy periods—much easier (Malik et al., 2024; Neba et al., 2024).\n",
        "\n",
        "###**1-3\tPROJECT OBJECTIVE**\n",
        "\n",
        "The main goal of this project is to see how well different forecasting models can predict weekly sales for several Walmart stores. We work with both simple and more advanced methods to understand how each one handles seasonal changes and the effect of economic variables. By comparing their results on the same dataset, the project aims to find which approach gives the most reliable short-term forecasts for practical retail use.\n",
        "\n",
        "###**1-4\tMODELS INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this project, four forecasting models are used so we can compare simple and more complex ways of predicting weekly sales. The Seasonal Naive model acts as the basic reference, since it repeats last year’s value and helps us judge whether other models actually improve the forecast. SARIMAX is added because it can work with seasonality and also include factors like holidays or economic indicators. Alongside these, two neural-network models, LSTM and GRU, are tested to see how well they capture patterns that do not follow a clear or regular shape. By looking at the results of all four models on the same data, we get a clearer picture of their strengths and limits."
